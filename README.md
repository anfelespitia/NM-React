# My Reads project
This is the repository that contains the code for Neighborhood map (react) . This app is built as the out of class project for Udacity's Nanodegree Front-End Web Developer. 

## Project description

This is a single-page application built using React featuring a map of my neighborhood. Functionality of this application includes: map markers to identify popular locations, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. I then implemented Foursquare's API to provide additional information about each of these locations.
