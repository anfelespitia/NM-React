# My Reads project
This is the repository that contains the code for The MyReads app. This app is built as the out of class project for Udacity's Nanodegree Front-End Web Developer. 

## Project description

The aim of this application is to allow the user to keep track of their own personal library. It includes a list of the books that are already in their possession or those in their wishlist. Each of these books will be grouped in three _shelves_ depending on their status:

* Currently reading
* Want to read
* Read

The user will be able to change a book status anytime, as well as add new titles to their collection or remove items from their library.
